<p><h2>computer science can build many applications that could warn people from this virus</h2></p>
<p>The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made  a number of weaknesses in the world’s healthcare systems and in global economy. In the new team of engineers and computer scientists they argue that the current pandemic moment has  to serve as a wake-up call for society and the public health in world community to give the opportunities of robotics</p>

<p>	“Robots have the ability  to be deployed for disinfection, delivering medications and food, measuring vital signs, and assisting border controls,”
In the piece, Yang and his co-authors wrote that despite occasional attention to the potential role of robotics in the  public health emergencies, little has been done to turn the vast potential into reality.</p>



<p>	The editorial lays out a long list of areas where robots could assist in or take over the work of health care professionals they can assist doctors in their work.
