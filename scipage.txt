<p>	“We can’t 3D-print doctors and  nurses, “however, we can increase their patient care capabilities through 21st century communications.”
The group is developing a telemedicine platform, called TV CV19, designed to enhance hospital-wide communications and help medical specialists  to care for more patients and  Clinicians with the most  care experience can care  on the sickest patients while having a telecommunications conduit to advise their colleagues. This way, technology can multiply expertise. care specialists can’t possibly monitor all patients, but their knowledge can easily be shared with other clinicians</p>


<p>	Ventilator control is  very important. As a patient’s lungs suffers from corona virus infection, ventilator pressure must be adjusted to avoid additional damage. The team has developed an experimental universal control system—built with a mobile phone and other off-the-shelf components in which will allow operators to adjust these ventilators and protect patients.

<p>Computers can also discover the location of existed place of corona virus</p>

<p>The pandemic has led enterprise software company    to diversify into life sciences, in a study demonstrating that AI models can learn the language of biology, just as they can do speech and image recognition. The idea is that the AI system will then be able to design proteins, or identify unknown proteins, that have specific properties, which could be used to treat COVID-19.</p>
<p><h2>So that .. computer engineering  has a great role in Covid–19 pandemic</h2></p>
